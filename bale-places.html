Spotted hyena, golden jackal, olive baboon, and the mountain nyala are among the other exciting species seen in and around the Web Valley, as well as some phenomenal birdlife. You are able to get much closer to the wolves here.

                    Harenna Forest is a montane tropical evergreen forest in Ethiopia's Bale Mountains. The forest covers the southern slope of the mountains, extending from 1450-3200 m from the southern portion of the Ethiopian highland and the national park. It is the second-largest natural forest in the country and is known for its native plants, mammals, amphibians, and birds, including many endemic species.

                    Less than an hour's walk from the center of Rira in Harenna Forest, the trail leads up to a waterfall, stacked almost on top of each other, tucked away in a narrow canyon filled with bamboo. The trail can either begin or end at the park's sub-headquarter located 1.5 km south of the village. Beginning and ending at the sub-headquarter, the round-trip hike takes two hours. The hike takes you through mountain forest, descends steeply into the open range, and then into the bamboo-filled canyon. The trek crosses the river on a natural land bridge, giving you a perfect view of the first shorter waterfall trail and will climb up around the forest to the second waterfall.

                    Manyate is a small village found at the southern edge of the park in the Harenna Forest, located at an altitude of 1600 m a.s.l., just 35 km from the Rira village by road. The area is known for its massive trees, now rare in Ethiopia, including fern pines (Podocarpus gracilior) and fig trees of massive girth. These trees are often over 30 m tall, and the branches of most are covered with dense epiphytes. In the shade of these trees also grows wild coffee or Coffea arabica. To spot the forest's abundant but elusive bird and wildlife, visit the Sankete Coffee House and sit down to be treated to a traditional coffee ceremony.

                <p class="honey-description">
                    Ethiopia is the leading producer of honey in Africa and the tenth-largest producer in the world. Traditional beekeeping has been practiced for thousands of years in Ethiopia. The Harenna Forest is known for its production of forest honey. The indigenous people of the area possess extensive knowledge of tree species and the value of beekeeping. The forest is endowed with various tree species that make excellent hives, which are made from hollowed-out tree trunks. These are assessed for durability and the attractiveness of the wood to the bees. Trees are marked for the use of hives, and tall trees with bare trunks are preferred as they act as a defense against climbing honey badgers. At the end of the dry season (late May to early July and again in late November), honey is harvested. Honey is harvested at night while the bees are less active, and wearing no protective clothing, the beekeeper climbs the trunk with incredible speed using only a single rope. Smoke from bound lichen is used to subdue the bees as honey is placed into a hardened leather sack. If the time is right, you can be a part of this process and taste the fresh honey as it is harvested. This is best done from the village of Rira, found at the base of the Harenna Forest.
